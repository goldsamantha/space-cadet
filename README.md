TODO:
Set up some form of local caching so that the NASA image doesn't have to load every time
  Perhaps this would be a good use case for cookies? This is good for us since we'll send fewer requests to NASA (yay) and it can work offline.

1. Make generic wallpaper
2. Add Space images from NASA's apod
3. Push to appstore
4. Make look good.
5. ??!!?
6. Prophet/Profit
